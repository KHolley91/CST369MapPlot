# CST369MapPlot
Uses GoogleMaps and Google Firebase to plot points on map where photos were taken by someone. Was done while in CST 369 
(Smartphone App Development) course at Roosevelt.
Initially this app was supposed to take a picture, plot the picture on the map, then display that picture as a marker on the map. 
I was having issues with managing persistence so I ended up learning about Google Firebase which was my first time working with
a real database outside of Microsoft Access/SQL. I ran into an issue with attempting to convert the bitmap to a string for storing 
on Firebase so as of now it is just markers and the text entered about them that is managed by Firebase. I will return to this 
eventually to make everything work as intended. Thank you.
